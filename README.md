# 🚀 **Power Management & Task Scheduling in Real-Time Embedded Systems**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **optimizing energy consumption** ⚡ in embedded systems with limited resources, such as battery-powered devices. We utilize **reinforcement learning (RL)** 🧠 and **dynamic voltage & frequency scaling (DVFS)** 🔄 to efficiently manage **task scheduling**, ensuring system constraints are met.

## 🏗 **Project Phases**  

### **🟢 Phase 1 - Offline Scheduling**  
📌 Designed an **RL-based model** to optimize task scheduling on multi-core homogeneous systems.  
📌 Applied **DVFS** to dynamically adjust **voltage & frequency** based on workload.  
📌 Ensured **Thermal Design Power (TDP)** constraints were not violated.  
📌 Used **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** scheduling for real-time tasks.  

### **🔵 Phase 2 - Online Scheduling**  
📌 Integrated **soft aperiodic tasks** dynamically into the system.  
📌 Developed an **adaptive task mapping strategy** 🗺 for real-time & aperiodic tasks.  
📌 Optimized **Quality of Service (QoS)** while maintaining system constraints.  
📌 Utilized **Slack Stealing Server** to efficiently handle task scheduling.

## 📊 **Results & Deliverables**  
✅ Analysis of **task schedulability** under various workloads.  
✅ Power consumption **trends for each core**.  
✅ QoS **evaluation across different system states**.  
✅ Final **implementation & report**.
