# 🚀 **Power Management & Task Scheduling in Real-Time Embedded Systems**  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **optimizing energy consumption** ⚡ in embedded systems with limited resources, such as battery-powered devices. We utilize **reinforcement learning (RL)** 🧠 and **dynamic voltage & frequency scaling (DVFS)** 🔄 to efficiently manage **task scheduling**, ensuring system constraints are met ✅.

## 🏗 **Project Phases**  

### **🟢 Phase 1 - Offline Scheduling**  
📌 Designed an **RL-based model** to optimize task scheduling on multi-core homogeneous systems.  
📌 Applied **DVFS** to dynamically adjust **voltage & frequency** based on workload.  
📌 Ensured **Thermal Design Power (TDP)** 🔥 constraints were not violated.  
📌 Used **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** ⏳ scheduling for real-time tasks.  

### **🔵 Phase 2 - Online Scheduling**  
📌 Integrated **soft aperiodic tasks** dynamically into the system.  
📌 Developed an **adaptive task mapping strategy** 🗺 for real-time & aperiodic tasks.  
📌 Optimized **Quality of Service (QoS)** 🎯 while maintaining system constraints.  
📌 Utilized **Slack Stealing Server** to efficiently handle task scheduling.
